A brief description of what this project does and who it's for

# HEALTHCARE-Dashboard


## Problem Statement

The TechnoEdge healthcare dataset includes product details such as IDs, categories, vendors, prices, and packaging. It also provides information on molecules/test types, brands, doses, dosage forms, shipping and insurance costs, and manufacturer location. It enables analysis of pricing trends, vendor and manufacturer performance, and the impact of packaging and weight on shipping and insurance costs.

TechnoEdge Healthcare Product pricing dataset contains information on product ID, vendor, brand name, unit price, dosage form, and manufacturer location, among other parameters, for various healthcare products.

## Objectives

1) Analyze pricing trends across sub-categories and product groups.

2) Identify top vendors and manufacturers by sales.

3) Determine top-selling molecules/test types and their prices.

4) Compare prices of different dosage forms of the same product.

5) Analyze the impact of weight on shipping and insurance costs.

6) Evaluate the effectiveness of discounts on sales.

7) Identify geographic trends in pricing.

8) Analyze the relationship between sales and packaging.



### Data Cleaning

1) Used the "Change Type" option in Power Query to alter data types for each column.

2) Utilized the "Replace Values" option in Power Query to edit the Sub-Category column to have each word capitalized.

3) Used the "Remove Duplicates" option in Power Query to remove duplicate values from the dataset.

4) Use the ROUND () function to round up the values in the shipping cost column to the nearest integer.
